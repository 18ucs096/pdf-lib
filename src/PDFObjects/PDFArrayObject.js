Represents a PDF Array Object.

From PDF 1.7 Specification, "7.3.6 Array Objects"
(http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf):
  An array object is a one-dimensional collection of objects arranged sequentially. Unlike arrays in many other computer languages, PDF arrays may be heterogeneous; that is, an arrayâ€™s elements may be any combination of numbers, strings, dictionaries, or any other objects, including other arrays. An array may have zero elements.

  An array shall be written as a sequence of objects enclosed in SQUARE BRACKETS (using LEFT SQUARE BRACKET (5Bh) and RIGHT SQUARE BRACKET (5Dh)).

  EXAMPLE:
    [549 3.14 false (Ralph) /SomeName]

  PDF directly supports only one-dimensional arrays. Arrays of higher dimension can be constructed by using arrays as elements of arrays, nested to any depth.

    this.array = array;
  }

  toString = () =>
    `[${this.array.map(String).join(' ')}]`;
